# GAN Dog Net

This dataset was taken from a paper from Khosla, and contains 20,000 images of dogs, with 120 different breeds!  

## 1. Summary 
GANs are 

##### Technical Overview
The pitfall of GANs are that they require massive amounts of compute power to train, meaning they need stacks of GPUs to train. GANs are essentially 2 neural networks, in this case 2 CNNs (convolutional neural network), competing against each other. I opted to use Google Cloud to train my network rather than AWS, since I would rather not pay to train a NN.
